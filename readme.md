# Access Tools

Improve your experience, one tool at a time.

A cross-browser extension that offers small changes (filters) to websites to improve the experience. It hides images without text alternatives, removes all positive tabindexes and you can probably come up with other great things it could do!

Do you know a small change in html/css/js that could improve lots of pages? Create a suggestion in the [issues](https://github.com/erikkroes/access-tools/issues).

## Add a filter

Add a name, description and function to `src/filters.js`.
